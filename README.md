# etch-a-sketch
An assignment in the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The assignment was to make a simple "etch-a-sketch". Boring, right? So I thought maybe I can make a really simple tool for pixel art. And I could.

Just for the hell of it I included a couple of external libraries for saving the finished art. It meant getting to know asynchronous functions for the first time.
